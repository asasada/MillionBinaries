# MillionBinaries

Project takes a million of binaries from [random.org API](https://www.random.org/clients/http/), counts occurrence of all sequences of 1, 2 and 3 binaries, and then shows its entry percentage in HTML format.
API allows about two requests of one million binaries from one IP per day, so if daily limit is exhausted, project takes binaries from local file. It's not truly random, but it contains data of one request from API and still provides the necessary data for project to work.
